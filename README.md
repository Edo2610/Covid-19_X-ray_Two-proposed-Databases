# Two-Scenarios-Covid-19-Recognition-on-Chest-X-RayScans-using-Ensemble-CNNs-approach

The recognition of Covid-19 infection from the X-ray images is an emerging field in machine learning and computer vision community. Despite the big efforts that have been made in this field since the appearance of Covid-19 disease (2019), the field still suffers from two drawbacks. First, the available X-ray scans labeled as Covid-19 infected are relatively small. Second, all the works that have been made in the field are separated; no unified data, classes, and evaluation protocol. In this work, based on the public and new collected data, we propose two X-ray covid-19 databases which are: Three-classes Covid-19 Ÿê and Five-classes Covid-19. For both databases, we test deep learning architectures. In addition, we propose an Ensemble-CNNs approach which outperforms the deep learning architectures and showing promising results in both databases. We make our databases of Covid-19 X-ray scans publicly available to encourage other researchers to use it as a benchmark for their studies.
